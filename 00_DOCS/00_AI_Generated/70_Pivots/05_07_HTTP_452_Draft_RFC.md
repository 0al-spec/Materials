# Abstract

This document proposes the registration of a new HTTP status code, 452 (Forbidden for AI Agents), indicating that the requested resource is forbidden specifically for automated requests generated by AI-based systems or agents.

# Status of This Memo

This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.  
Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. The list of current Internet-Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

This document is intended for eventual publication as a Standards Track RFC. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group mailing list or the author.

# 1. Introduction

HTTP has evolved to accommodate a wide variety of clients, including human-operated browsers, API consumers, and autonomous agents. As AI-powered agents proliferate, site operators increasingly seek mechanisms to differentiate between human and machine-originated requests.

This document introduces HTTP status code 452 to signal that a particular resource is forbidden for access by AI agents while potentially still accessible to other clients.

# 2. Terminology

The key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*, *SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *NOT RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*, and *OPTIONAL* in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# 3. Use Cases and Motivation

Examples of scenarios where HTTP 452 is useful include:

- Content moderation systems where AI agents are disallowed from retrieving sensitive or copyrighted information.
- Licensing restrictions that prohibit AI models from consuming specific datasets.
- Legal compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, content ownership laws) that differentiate automated processing from human interaction.

# 4. Protocol Overview

The HTTP 452 status code allows servers to explicitly signal that the current request is denied because the client is identified as an AI-based system.

Servers *MAY* use various heuristics or signals (e.g., User-Agent strings, IP ranges, behavior patterns) to determine the AI nature of a client.

# 5. Detailed Specification

## 5.1 HTTP Status Code Definition

```
452 Forbidden for AI Agents
```

The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it for AI-based clients. This status *MUST NOT* be used for general access control that applies to all clients.

## 5.2 Response Semantics

A server that returns a 452 status code *SHOULD* include an explanation in the response body, possibly including guidance on how a human user might access the same resource.

```http
HTTP/1.1 452 Forbidden for AI Agents
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "access_denied",
  "reason": "Access restricted for AI-based agents. Use a human-accessible interface."
}
```

# 6. Security Considerations

Introducing a new status code does not introduce new security vulnerabilities by itself. However, implementers *MUST* ensure that detection mechanisms used to identify AI agents do not expose the system to spoofing or denial-of-service vectors.

Additionally, misuse of this code could result in discriminatory practices or overblocking.

# 7. IANA Considerations

This document requests the registration of the following HTTP status code in the "HTTP Status Code Registry":

| Code | Description                 | Reference     |
|------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| 452  | Forbidden for AI Agents     | [this document] |
